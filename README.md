## Copywriting and Readability (Outcome 4)

Throughout the website, careful attention has been paid to copywriting principles to ensure content is easy to read, digestible, and effective in conveying its message.

**Key copywriting strategies applied:**

* **Plenty of Headings:** The use of `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<h3>` tags (`section-heading`, `story-item h3`, etc.) breaks down content into manageable, scannable chunks across `index.html`, `blog.html` and `company.html`. Headings act as informal outlines, allowing users to quickly grasp the topic of each section before deciding to read further.
* **Bullet Points:** Bulleted lists allow for optimal readability and allow users to easily understand and store that information.  Almost any series of items separated with 
commas has potential to be formatted into a bulleted list.
* **Short Paragraphs:** Long blocks of text are generally avoided across the HTML files. Content is broken into shorter paragraphs, making information easier to digest and less intimidating to read.
* **Frontloaded Important Information:** Key messages and core benefits are placed at the beginning of paragraphs or sections to ensure the most important information is absorbed first, even by users who skim. This is observed in introductory sections of `index.html`, `blog.html` and `company.html`.
* **Calling Attention to Key Terms and Phrases:** Important terms and metrics (e.g., "**40% increase**," "**$50,000**," "**24% conversion boost**") are highlighted using `<b>` tags drawing the reader's eye to critical information and reinforce the main points.
* **Omit Unnecessary Words:** Text is written concisely, avoiding jargon and superfluous language to maintain clarity and efficiency in communication. Every word serves a purpose to maximize impact and reduce cognitive load on the reader.
